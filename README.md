# Resume
Hii I created this app to be able to add new projects and experince. Its basically a portfolio project
There were certain functionalities in the project which i wanted to implement during initial phases of development but i couldnt 
finish it due to time constrains and a lot of bugs. So I implemented the basic version of it just to get started.
I hosted this project on render free tier. Not recommended After 15mins of inactivity the server is slow to load.
feel free to use this project make sure to update settings file and migrate.
